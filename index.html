<h1>Visual Artist, Earth Scientist</h1>
  
<p>Amanda Hunter has always recognized the symbiotic relationship between visual art and science & technology. Her background 
  in Environmental Visual Communication embraces the need for science and data to be communicated
  visually and made digestible for broader audiences. Furthermore, as an artist, she found the need 
  to incorporate important social scientific commentary necessary in the deeper meanings of her 
  narratives and self expression. 
</p>  
<p> "Great communication and narrative builds our communities to be creative, thoughtful,
  and problem solving. It also allows for the sharing of knowledge in innovative ways. But the 
   "visual" aspect of communication makes this process enjoyable"-Amanda Hunter
</p>
<p> She has successfully filmed and produced a documentary called "Beyond Crisis," which focused 
   on smart action on climate. It featured interviews from over 46 leading scientific experts across 
   the world and was successfully screened in 4 different countries. https://www.beyondcrisisfilm.com/

<p>Amanda Hunter has over 8 years experience in the visual arts space. She's a published fashion photographer, 
  master of studio lighting, a wedding and corporate videographer, and finally an UAV pilot and photographer. 
  It is this last project where she has chosen to focus her current attention. 
  </p>
<p>After completing her Masters degree in Geographic Information Systems, Hunter now combines her UAV photography
  with advanced photogrammetry, multi-spectral imaging, as well as thermal imaging to provide cutting edge remote 
  sensing packages to her clients.
  
<p> Her passion for making science & tech visually interesting are some of her greatest motivators and create an additional 
  layer of value to the work and relationships she builds. The birds eye view has never been more exciting than it is today.
