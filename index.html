<h1 class="center">Visual Artist, Earth Scientist</h1>
  
   <p>Amanda Hunter has always recognized the symbiotic relationship between visual art and science & technology. Her background 
  in Environmental Visual Communication embraces the need for science and data to be communicated
  visually and made digestible for broader audiences. Furthermore, as an artist, she found the need 
  to incorporate important social scientific commentary necessary in the deeper meanings of her 
      narratives and self expression.</p>

  and problem solving. It also allows for the sharing of knowledge in innovative ways. But the 
      "visual" aspect of communication makes this process enjoyable"-Amanda Hunter </h5>
